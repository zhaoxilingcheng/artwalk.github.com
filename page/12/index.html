            <p>I got the score last night and was shocked.</p>
<p>For these days I always check my score, but as it’s mid-autumn festival and  National Day, they didn’t publish the score.</p>
<p>Three months ago, I had planned to take the exam again for the third time if I do not pass the last one. I only got a 5 on the first one, But I just wanted to gauge my real level in English. the score was totally acceptable. But for this time, even though I didn’t prepare either, I do a lot about the speaking part because I had one hour class with a foreign teacher everyday. And the last time, I didn’t even finished the second part, and for this time, I talked a lot with the examiner and made him laughed, so I think it will be at least 5+. But as the result, it’s still be 4.5.</p>
<p>For the reading and listening part, I increased them 0.5 for each, as I don’t have time to finish the second paragraph last time, it’s reasonable. But for the writing part, it’s decreased 0.5, so the total score was still 5.0.</p>
<p>It was hard for me to accepted this fact, because it not only means that my hard work was wasted but it also indicated where my actual limit is.</p>
<p>It made my sick for several hours, should I insist or re-plan?</p>
<p>According to TaiJi, I should reorder my schedule and base it on the fact, not illusion.</p>
<p>After all, I have to achieve goals step by step as a Diaosi.</p>
<p>But, I still need a little bit of time to heal this sorrow.</p>

<p>PS: the title means “然并卵” in Chinese.</p>

            <p><a href="http://music.163.com/#/song?id=26152612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Ends</a><br>It’s a nice music, for summer really ends.</p>
<p>I wrote less, read less and felt bad in this year, before this, I’m in my gap year, and was productive and efficient, mind flow came up . So, I began to wonder why and try to return.</p>
<p>For I went to the gopher China in April, and meet with one IT crop. CTO, and talk to him that maybe I’m in a bottleneck period.</p>
<p>But it’s September now, the summer ends, I’ve been in Beijing for a most one year, and still trapping in this mass state.</p>
<p>I tried to figure out</p>
<h2 id="The-model"><a href="#The-model" class="headerlink" title="The model"></a>The model</h2><p>First, the style of living (surviving in deed) was not like Hangzhou, when I was in Hangzhou, I can rent a flat which company was nearby that I can walk to work, and I have my own bathroom in my room so one bother me. But in Beijing, if I still use the same model, I have to live in an old flat, which the building was even old than me! even worse, I have to live with neighbors, share the bathroom kitchen and all other things. So you have to pray for your neighbors are good.<br>For me, as an internal person, I just want to live alone. </p>
<p>Once I resize this cause, I rent a new flat immediately and I’ll move in the end of this month, but one year past and never came back.</p>
<h2 id="English"><a href="#English" class="headerlink" title="English"></a>English</h2><p>I read at least 10 books each month before, but for I narrowed to English edition recent months, the numbers dropped so fiercely that I hardly finished a book in one month.</p>
<p>No books makes me feel sick, and no input, no output. That’s an important reason that I stopped posting blog and The little master series. Needless to say I forced myself all new blogs have to write in English.</p>
<h2 id="Procrastination"><a href="#Procrastination" class="headerlink" title="Procrastination"></a>Procrastination</h2><p>It seems a universal problem. But after I read too much GTDs and found the healthy circle based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polyphasic sleep</a>. I can do 16+ <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/4198078/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pomodoroes</a> one day.<br>After I return to work in company, I just do what I want do, and I thought I was still efficient.</p>
<p>Even though I already outsource apply instead DIY, preparing IELTS and working hard still a big challenge to me, not only because I unknown the starting date but also my co-workers ungelivable. I have to write almost 70% codes in the main project and even to rewrote some functions off his part. I want to figure out one way to manage our new team( for right now I like a TL assistant)</p>
<p>So, all the apps that I used were return, and I feels it really improve my situation.</p>
<h2 id="Slack"><a href="#Slack" class="headerlink" title="Slack"></a>Slack</h2><p>It’s not that Slack, although I have to write some code according to it’s API in future for our CI.</p>
<p>I found something I runaround but I have to face it again in future with more effort. like hope my co-workers write more, read the translate version books, excise, etc.</p>
<p>So, I dared not hope anymore.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s all, winter is coming.</p>

            <p>I finished my Gap year and went to my current company last autumn.</p>
<p>I did’t do much as a new comer for the first month, and there was a software engineer from AMAP with 10 years experience. Everytime I had something to ask him, he explained it in the deepest level, and inspired me by rhetorical questions patiently. But at the same time, I found thousands and thousands Copy &amp; Paste lines of code in the project. Yes, I counted it by using <a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLOC</a>, and found that it’s almost 20 thousands lines in total.</p>
<p>As Objective-C is a excessively long and prolix programming language( which means that your have to write dozens of code to implement the same function which may only a line in Ruby 😫 ), it’s rational for the count of this project. But Copy &amp; Paste should always avoided, worse I saw global variables and magic numbers are everywhere.😰</p>
<p>It’s odd, isn’t it? If a 10 years experienced programer who can deal with pointer easily and knows computer systems deeply, why didn’t he pay any attention to the code styles. After all, we need to prepare for adding new members in the team and new features at any time.</p>
<p>He said that most of code was written by him, it’s quick to fix bugs. However, he went to a start company of his friend in next month. So he just left, and also, the anfractuosity code.😭😭😭</p>
<p>to be continued…</p>

            <p>Slack was always loading even if I use shadowsocks with <code>Auto Proxy Mode</code>.</p>
<p>I found that the domain of slack was accessible in chrome console so the real reason was <code>amazonaws</code> server was blocked.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/filter-cheatsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adblock Plus filters explained</a>, I added two rules in <code>Edit User Rule for ...</code>  </p>
<figure class="highlight 1c"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="string">||global.ssl.fastly.net^</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">||amazonaws.com^</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And <strong>don’t forget</strong> to click <code>update PAC from ...</code> once again, otherwise the new user rules you just added won’t take effect immediately.</p>
<p>It seems also fixed <code>trello.com</code> incidentally.</p>

            <p>I was wondering why the family name was always behind the given name in my Contacts, no matter when I check my iPhone or Mac. First I believe some configs was not correct, until I found I messed up the First and Last name.   </p>
<p>In fact, given name was known as the first name, which was opposite in China.</p>
<p>Althought only dozens of people in my Contacts, but I still don’t want to edit them manually as an iOS programmer →_→</p>
<p>So, just open Xcode and new an <code>OS X Application -&gt; command line tool</code> and paster the snippet below to your <code>main.swift</code>, then <code>cmd + R</code> …</p>
